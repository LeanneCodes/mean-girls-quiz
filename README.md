# Iconic Movie Quotes: Mean Girls Quiz

With the Mean Girls movie debuting in cinemas in 2004, it became one of most quoted films of all time! However, with the incredible movie script delivering so many fan-favourite quotes, the aim of the quiz is to see if fans can guess who said which quote correctly.

The quiz is built with ten questions, with each question showing four answers, where only one answer is correct. The quiz aims to test the fan’s knowledge of the film, while also reminding them some great quotes that made the film what it is today.

* The Mean Girls Makeup Photo
  * This image does three jobs for the visual appearance of the quiz. Firstly, it reminds users who the main characters were for the film, which can help put them in the right frame of mind, when recalling who said which quote correctly. 
  * Secondly, the image depicts four girls who have makeup on and three of them are applying makeup to “Cady” (the girl in the centre). This fed in well with the chosen background image, which is an animated collection of lip print impressions in various shades. Which was chosen to mimic the lip print impressions from the girls in the photo.
  * Finally, the image helps set the colour palette for the quiz, to keep the quiz looking well put-together and consistent.

* Background Image
  * As mentioned previously this image was chosen to align well with the theme of makeup and the colours within the background image are a match for the colours within the group photo.
  * Additionally, the background image has been resized to accommodate various screen sizes, so that the scale of the screen’s device does not distort or distract the user from playing the quiz.
  * A 50% transparency filter was applied to the background image so that it wasn't distracting to the user's game play.

* Start Game: “Begin Quiz”
  * When the user first loads the quiz, they will see an introduction title, “Can you guess who said which quote?” and a “Begin Quiz” button.
  * The introduction title is there to provide context to the user on what is expected from them. I.e., The quiz is a compilation of quotes, and the user needs to guess which character said which quote.
  * The “Begin Quiz” button acts as call-to-action button, prompting the user to click on the button in order to start the quiz.
  * The quiz was built in this way, so that the user can decide if they want to participate in the quiz before being launched into it. From user research, 80% of participants wanted to be given a choice to start the quiz, as they felt leading with question one came across a little intense, as they felt they were not mentally ready to begin. 
  * Even though there is no timer appended to the quiz, this seemed to be the preference for the users, hence the structure of the quiz.

* In-Game Play
  * Once the user has clicked the “Begin Quiz” button, a new frame appears, where the user is asked who said a specific quote and a list of four potential answers, where only one is correct.
  * When the user hovers over a particular answer on desktop or where a mouse is connected to a device, the button cell changes from a neutral state (white button, purple border and text) to the hovered state (purple button and white text).
  * If the option they select is correct, the button will change from the hovered state to the correct state (green button and border with purple text). Additionally, the score will increase by one and it will be noted in the middle of the frame. As there are a maximum of ten questions, the score will be out of ten.
  * If the option they chose was incorrect, the hovered state cell will turn to the wrong state (red button and border with white text) and their score will not increase. Moreover, the user will receive an alert stating the option they chose was incorrect and the correct answer is highlighted in green.

* The “Next” Button
  * The “Next” button allows the user to progress throughout the game. They can only do this once they have clicked on an answer button, whether that’s correct or incorrect.
  * If the user has not chosen an answer, the “Next” button will not appear.

* In-Game Alerts
  * As the user progresses through the quiz, they will experience at least one alert.
  * If they choose an incorrect answer, an alert will flag telling them the answer they chose is wrong and the correct answer is highlighted in green.
  * If they choose the correct answer, no alerts will be shown. This was done to minimise the disruption to the game. Additionally, if the user taking part in the quiz is a Mean Girls movie fan, it’s likely they will get quite a few correct. Therefore, this was done to encourage a positive user experience.
  * Furthermore, when the user has completed the game, a final alert will pop up with a message either congratulating the user on their score or encouraging them to try again or watch the film to improve their movie quotes knowledge.

* The “Restart Quiz” Button
  * This button appears when the user has come to end of the game. It will bring the user back to the first question.
  * It’s an opportunity for users to try the quiz again to improve their previous score or pass over to a friend/family/household member to see if they can get a higher score.

## Features Left to Implement
* Soon, it would be great to add more questions and use a shuffle feature. Where the quiz will randomly choose 10 questions from the bank of questions, so users can’t memorise the answers so well for a high score.
